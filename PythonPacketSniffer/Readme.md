Python Packet Sniffer (Educational)

A simple Python-based packet sniffer developed for educational and cybersecurity learning purposes.
This tool captures TCP and UDP traffic generated by the user’s own machine and displays basic packet information in real time.

⚠️ This project is for educational purposes only.
It is designed to help understand how network traffic works at a basic level.

🚀 Features

Captures TCP and UDP packets

Filters traffic to show only packets related to your own IP

Displays source & destination IPs and ports

Real-time packet monitoring

Lightweight and easy to understand codebase

🧠 How It Works

Detects the local machine’s IP address automatically

Listens to network traffic using Scapy

Prints packet summaries only if the traffic belongs to your system

Helps visualize how applications communicate over the network

🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.10+

Scapy library

Npcap installed (Windows)

🔐 Administrator privileges are required
Packet sniffing works at a low network level and needs elevated permissions.

▶️ Installation
pip install scapy


Make sure Npcap is installed before running the script.

▶️ Usage (Windows)

Open Command Prompt or Terminal as Administrator

Navigate to the project directory

Run the script:

python sniffer.py


Packets related to your own IP address will start appearing in the terminal.

📁 Example Output
[TCP] 192.168.1.108:53467 -> 20.189.173.2:443
[UDP] 192.168.1.108:51234 -> 8.8.8.8:53
